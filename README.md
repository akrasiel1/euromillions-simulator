# Euromillions Simulator
## As the title implies, this program generates 2 lists of random numbers picked from 2 arrays (the main numbers, ranging from 1 to 50 - and the lucky stars numbers, ranging from 1 to 12). Just like the real deal, it will pick 5 choices among the main numbers array, and pick 2 from the lucky stars array. The program also has conditions in place to avoid duplicate numbers from showing on list. Another thing, this app has been built just to test my JS knowledge, and may NOT necessarily pick winning numbers :wink:
